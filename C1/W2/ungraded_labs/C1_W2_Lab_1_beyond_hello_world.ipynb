Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it would have been easier to write the function `y=2x-1` directly instead of bothering with using machine learning to learn the relationship between `x` and `y`.\n",

If it is at index = 5, then it is a sandal, and so forth. See the short code block below which demonstrates these concepts.
