Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it would have been easier to write the function `y=2x-1` directly instead of bothering with using machine learning to learn the relationship between `x` and `y`.\n",

For example, in your classification model which has 10 units in the output dense layer, having the highest value at `index = 4` means that the model is most confident that the input clothing image is a coat. If it is at index = 5, then it is a sandal, and so forth. See the short code block below which demonstrates these concepts.

It might have taken a bit of time for you to wait for the training to do that, and you might have thought 'wouldn't it be nice if I could stop the training when I reach a desired value?' -- i.e. 60% accuracy might be enough for you, and if you reach that after 3 epochs, why sit around waiting for it to finish a lot more epochs....So how would you fix that? Like any other program...you have callbacks! Let's see them in action..."
